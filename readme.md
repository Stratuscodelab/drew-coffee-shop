Python3 Coffee Shop Script. 0_0

Discovering different methods of programing, this script demonstrates the following

- IF and ELSE - Used on questions (Yes & No)

- Functions - In this case the exit() is used to exit the program when a particular name is mentioned on first question.

- Integer addition - There are two examples of integer addition used, the first one is for price and the second is used when adding additional drinks to the order ( original price plus extra price )

- Variables - Plenty used on pretty much every line.

- Operators, "and" "or" used for asking if the customer is evil "and" done good deeds, the "OR" is used in the extra names for banned list. Both used together will decide if the band user can enter the shop.

* Import module - Imported pYfiglet for ASCII logo.

To run this script download to your PC and run within your python environment.

This Coffee Shop script will be updated with further python examples to demonstrate ability to write and understand Python.
